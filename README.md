# Go Equations

A Simple CLI for solving simple equations. Written in Go.

Right now supports these kinds of equations:

- Linear
  - `y = mx + b`
  - `y2 - y1 = m(x2 - x1)`
- Quadratic
  - `y = ax^2 + bx + c`
  - `y = a(x - h)^2 + k`

More may come in the future.

This is a version of a Python script I wrote many years ago, so the code style may not be great, 
but I'm just messing around with Go, for now.
